<h1>
    Synopsis
</h1>
<p>
    Based on the bestselling novel by Joyce Carol Oates, Blonde boldly reimagines the 
    life of one of Hollywood's most enduring icons, Marilyn Monroe. From her volatile childhood as
     Norma Jeane, through her rise to stardom and romantic entanglements, Blonde blurs the lines of
      fact and fiction to explore the widening split between her public and private selves. The film boasts a cast led
       by Ana de Armas.</p>
      <p>
        The film was able to do Marilyn Monroe’s trials and tribulations justice without glamorizing her trauma.

        While Ana de Armas has described the film as a “daring,
         unapologetic and feminist take on [Marilyn's] story", and 
         she looks incredible as the Hollywood icon, the film has also
          received plenty of criticism for its sensationalist depiction of
         the late star's life. </p>

         <p class="review">
            “But for the brave and the curious, Blonde should prove fascinating,
             an engrossing slow-motion car wreck of a movie that puts you squarely in
              the driver’s seat of the oncoming vehicle.”<br>
