        Synopsis
    </h1>
    <p>
      In 2045 the planet is on the brink of chaos and collapse, but people find salvation
       in the OASIS: an expansive virtual reality universe created by eccentric James Halliday.
        When Halliday dies, he promises his immense fortune to the first person to discover a digital
         Easter egg that's hidden somewhere in the OASIS.</p>
          <p>
          Then begins a hunt for his fortune and ownership
           of the whole VRMMO world with puzzles and riddles based on Halliday's obsession with pop culture of decades past.
          </p>
          <p>
            After years of searching for Halliday's "Easter Egg," one average teenager named Wade Watts solves the first clue,
             sparking excitement and hope back to the hunt, and throwing him into a world of people willing to kill for the information
              he has, changing his life forever.</p>

            The science-fiction writer John Scalzi has aptly referred to Ready Player One as a ‘nerdgasm’
             [and] there can be no better one-word description of this ardent fantasy artifact about fantasy culture.
              . . . But Mr. Cline is able to incorporate his favorite toys and games into a perfectly accessible narrative.<br>
